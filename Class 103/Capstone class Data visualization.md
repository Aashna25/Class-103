#  Capstone class: Data visualization



● Learn to use plotly and pandas for data visualization 

● Visualize internet users data from different countries and compare it with their per capita income using line graph, histograms and scatter plots

In the last few classes - we've learned about python syntax, how to run python programs and how to automate our tasks using python. Today, we will start learning about how to work with data using python.

You must have heard about the fact that different companies like Google, Facebook, etc., keep collecting data about users. What is this data that these companies collect? How are they useful?

Data is very important for several companies today. Companies collect data from users to understand their users and design products which meet their needs. Any idea what form is this data collected in?

Data becomes much more meaningful for humans when visualized in the form of graphs. Let's learn how to use python to visualize our data.

What are the data types that we use while writing code?

We know about the use of -dictionary -list -float -integer -string.

There is another data object which is called a dataframe. In the data frame the data is aligned in tabular form [i.e.](https://i.e./), rows and columns. And these rows and columns can have any type of data such as string or integer or float.

We can create our own data frame too. To create a data frame we need a python library called pandas. pandas library helps us with data manipulation and analysis. 

First we need to install this library to our system.
